GAME 5 has goalpost interactions, a centre line which does nothing, and better colisions (with pink being interactive but not moveable now) although I still don't think the collisions work exactly the same as in haxball. Someone who knows python well would be lovely for you to look at the game description and my code and try to improve

GAME 5 line 285 - made it so that players will also bounce off each other. STEFAN 12/07/2018 14:47

GAME 5 fixed bug where you could push ball out of play area, and leave play area yourself, changed dimensions to map and minor changes. PHILIP 7/12/2018 10:06 EST (dates are gonna be a mess)

Created (hopefully the final one) GAME 6 - the player who conceded the last goal now must kick off (red kicks off round one) and the other player is prvented from exiting his half/ entering the middle circle. Pink also can be controlled with a keyboard now (see file for new controls). All that is missing is a timer/score cap and I am not sure what that is meant to be.
